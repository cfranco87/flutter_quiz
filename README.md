## Getting Started

# Quiz App

I recently finished the flutter tutorial by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller to learn the programming language. To improve on this exercise I've decide to make changes, wanting to practice what I've learned but also play around and expand my knowledge

# Things to changes:

-animation waves for the intro screen 

-expand questions/improve color scheme 

-think of how to improve UI

-putting button on top of animation

# What were the changes:

-Need to think about color theory, add 'oxff' to use hex colors (#BF3475)
 ex: Color(oxffBF3475) - Fuchsia Purple

-Thinking on how to organize the code, into specific folders, to have clean code

-For this app, I tried out several fonts trying to find the right one.It ended up being pirataOne from google_fonts
